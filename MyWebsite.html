	<p>Hello! My name is <strong>Pedro</strong> and this is my new website page. Coded by myself!</p>
	<p>So, for starters, I was born in Brazil and moved to the US in 2014 to start my college career. During the last four years, besides pursuing a bachelors degree in Business Administration from Chestnut Hill College (Philadelphia), I played on the college tennis team, where I had many experiences and finally reaching 100 career wins. Also, here I met my girlfriend, Laure-Anne (who played on the tennis team as well), and made great friendships. With two of these friends, I started a startup company called <em>Dream Big</em>, where we work with students who seek personal development and provide them life-changing experiences throughout exchange programs around the globe.</p>
	
	<p>To sum up, now I am a college graduate currently working on my own business and developing some other projects as well.</p>
	<p>I decided to start this programming course because coding is something extremely important and I am eager to learn more about this new world!</p>
	<p>Obrigado,</p>
	<p>Pedro Regalin.</p>
